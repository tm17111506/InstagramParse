## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Style the login page to look like the real Instagram login page.
- [x] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed.

- [x] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse
- User Profiles:

- [x] User can comment on a post and see all comments for each post in the post details screen.

- [ ] Implement a custom camera view.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I am curious how the "story" feature of Instagram would / could be implemented in this parse-instagram.
2. Similar to last time, I tried to focus on modualizing the code such that there are less repeated code and more organization. I think this practice can bring in more clean / structured code and produce less bugs.
